# **Project Proposal**
## **Team Members:** 
Andrea Baumgartner & Alejandro Wills 

## **Project Idea:**
Create a Content Aggregator 

## **Our Project's Mission:**
It is very likely that most of us come across a website that compiles material from all across the internet onto a single page, from which we can pick and choose what we want to see. In the contemporary global world, many of us desire to remain on top of things but find that we do not have enough time. The amount of content aggregators on the web have increased in recent years due to this. 

The purpose and mission behind our project is to create a content aggregator so individuals may use such services to scan over all of the key news and information without having to resort towards navigating through various sites to do so as it may be overwhelming and highly time consuming. 

## **What is a Content Aggregator?**
A content aggregator is essentially a technology based tool that gathers, aggregates, and accumulates content pieces from many sorts of media outlets, such as articles, social media postings, videos, photos, updates, and press releases, and then presents all of that material via links on one single page.

## **Things We Need to Look Into:**
* Django framework 
    * Useful for recording all the scrapped data
* URL Scraping 
    * HTTP request sender 
    * BeautifulSoup
* How to save scrapped content onto a database/page
* Look into making website
